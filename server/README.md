# Task Management API

This is an API for a Task Management Application. It provides endpoints for managing tasks, lists, boards, and users.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

### Installing

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/quang-pham-1109/task-manager-server
```

2. Create a database and `.env` file

- Run the `Database.sql` script in the `/database` directory to create the database.
- Create an `.env` file with syntax similar to the `.env.example`
- The `schema.prisma` file is purely to establish the connection to the database and typing for Typescript. Therefore, you can adjust it to your liking, I was using Supabase for development so your config might varies slightly.

3. Build the project

```sh
yarn install
yarn run build
```

4. Run the project

```sh
yarn run dev
```
